# About
- I challenged myself to master the basics of Arduino.
- In order to do that I need to make some projects, and make sure each one actually teaches me smth instead of being too easy like blinking a LED.
- The projects come from the recommendation of ChatGPT, tailored to what I currently have with my starter kit.
- Of course, I also asked ChatGPT to give me hard projects since I'm already an experienced programmer (im literally the creator of [Lichess Puzzle Timer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ifloeapglolidlgbfjnfidpnpnobddof), although I suck at competitive programming).
- Stopping from January 4, 2026 to January 21, 2026. Stopped at the 4th micro-project.
